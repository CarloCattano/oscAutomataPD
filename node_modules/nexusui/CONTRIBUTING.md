# Contributing

A pre-emptive thank you for contributing! Open Source projects like this one survive with the active participation of community members who can help push it forward.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

## Pull Request Process

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

* A Pull Request has a higher chance of being accepted if the work has been acknowledged and assigned by the team.
* If a relevant issue exists, please discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on Github.
* If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
* Please do not commit any build / install dependencies directly to the repo.
* Whenever possible, update the JSDocs annotations and/or README.md with relevant changes. Online documentation is generated by running `npm run docgen`.
* Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
  * We use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to automatically bump versions in the package.json and write to the CHANGELOG.
  * Call it using `npm run release`.
* Please respond to discussion during Review of your Pull Request.
